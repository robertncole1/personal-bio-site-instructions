# Personal Bio Site
> Your portfolio site (aka personal site) will be a touchpoint for potential employers. When a potential employer looks at your personal site, it will often be their first interaction with you and something that you've made. Needless to say, you will want it to look good!

We will assign personal site assignments throughout the course for a couple of reasons -- (1) to practice skills we have learned, and (2) to build up something you can show off.

- CREATE A NEW BRANCH FOR EACH PART OF YOUR ASSIGNMENT
  - Branch off of that branch to make updates and make PRs against that branch

## Assignments
